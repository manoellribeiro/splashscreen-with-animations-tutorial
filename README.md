## About this Project

This is a Flutter app developed to exemplify how to implement a Splash Screen with Flare animations using Flutter.
You can find the medium post with the tutorial step by step [here.](https://medium.com/flutter-comunidade-br/splash-screen-com-animação-no-flutter-f7bd6e84cf5a)

## Why?

I start to learning how to use animations in Flutter apps, so I realize how simple and useful it is to get started with animations in Flutter, so I decided to write my first article to Flutter - Comunidade BR about that.
